- Ideas:
    - predict success using other variables
        - define what success is (1.5x profit?)
    - predict IMDB score using other variables
        - budget
        - director
        - actors
        - keywords


1. Data preprocessing:
    - cleaning
    - filtering
    - transforming
    - normalizing

2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): 
    - distribution, 
    - correlation, 
    - outliers, and missing values.

3. Feature selection and engineering: 
    - Identifying and selecting the most relevant features to include in the model, and creating new features that may be useful for prediction.

4. Model selection and training: 
    - Selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithm(s) based on the problem, and training the model(s) on the data.

5. Model evaluation: 
    - Evaluating the performance of the model(s) using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
