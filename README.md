- [x] Data preparation
    - Added features into HDB resale dataset:
        1. Get coordinates and address of flat sold
        2. Get all MRT stations info and created "nearest MRT" and "distance to nearest MRT" feature
        3. Get all primary and secondary schools info and created "schools within 1km" feature
        4. Get all shopping malls info and created "nearest mall", "mall nearest distance", "mall within 500m" and "mall within 1km" feature
        5. Get all hawker centres info and created "hawkers within 1km" feature
        6. Connected to Google Map's API to get "travel time to RP (Raffles Place MRT Station) in minutes" feature

# 1. Problem Formulation
**Our Dataset**: 

**Our Motivation**: 

**Our Question**: How can we predict the prices of HDB resale flats?


# 2. Data Preparation and Cleaning


# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis


# 4. Machine Learning
### After finding some possible factors that might affect the HDB resale price, we can attempt to predict the resale price of a given flat for future buyers using machine learning models. The models that we have chosen are Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost.

## 4A. Support Vector Regression


## 4B. Random Forest Regression


## 4C. XGBoost
